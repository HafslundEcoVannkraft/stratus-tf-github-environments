# AI Context for stratus-tf-github-environments

This document provides essential context for AI assistants working on the `stratus-tf-github-environments` project. It helps maintain consistency across AI sessions and ensures new AI interactions understand the project's purpose, architecture, and constraints.

## 🎯 Project Overview

### Purpose
This Terraform module automates the creation of GitHub deployment environments for Azure infrastructure within the **Stratus Corp Azure Landing Zone** architecture. It establishes secure OIDC federation between GitHub Actions and Azure, eliminating the need for static credentials.

### Key Value Proposition
- **Generic Infrastructure Support**: Works with any Azure infrastructure (Container Apps, AKS, Functions, etc.)
- **Secure Authentication**: OIDC federation replaces static secrets
- **Centralized Management**: IaC repository controls all environment creation, the IaC repo allready have the required Identity and role assignment to create new identities.
- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Convention-based role mapping for infinite flexibility
- **Enterprise Ready**: Designed for corporate environments with strict security requirements

## 🏗️ Architecture Context

### Three-Layer Environment Model

1. **Stratus Landing Zone** (Azure Subscription Level)
   - Complete Azure subscription with shared resources
   - Named: `{code_name}-{environment}` (e.g., "myapp-dev")
   - Contains: Multiple deployment targets, shared networking, DNS, monitoring

2. **Deployment Targets** (Application Level)
   - Logical separation within a subscription
   - Examples: `web-apps`, `api-services`, `data-processing`, `container-apps`, `kubernetes`
   - Independent scaling and resource allocation
   - Technology agnostic (any Azure infrastructure)

3. **GitHub Deployment Environments** (Workflow Level)
   - Control deployment workflows and security policies
   - Examples: `web-dev-ci`, `api-prod-cd`, `data-validate`
   - Each gets unique managed identity and federated credentials

### Dynamic Role Assignment Convention
- Environment names ending with `-{suffix}` automatically get `role_assignments.{suffix}`
- Examples: `prod-ci` → `role_assignments.ci`, `dev-deploy` → `role_assignments.deploy`
- `global` role assignments always applied
- Supports any custom convention (ci/cd, validate/deploy, test/backup, etc.)

### Execution Model
- **NOT a standalone module** - part of larger Stratus workflow
- **Runs in IaC repository context** for Azure access and VNet connectivity
- **Workflow copies module code** - no local Terraform files needed
- **Remote state integration** - reads configuration from upstream infrastructure

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **Terraform Module**: Creates Azure managed identities and GitHub environments
- **GitHub Workflow**: `github-environment-vending.yml` for execution
- **YAML Configuration**: `github-environments.yaml` for environment definitions
- **Remote State Integration**: Reads from upstream infrastructure outputs

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Generic Infrastructure Support
- **Technology Agnostic**: Supports any Azure infrastructure pattern
- **Convention-Based**: Dynamic role assignment based on naming patterns
- **Flexible Mapping**: Deployment targets can be any infrastructure type
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend for new Azure services

### Security First
- **OIDC Federation**: No static credentials stored
- **Least Privilege**: Role assignments based on environment type and naming convention
- **Conservative Auto-merge**: Only security updates auto-merge
- **Environment Isolation**: Each environment gets unique identity

### Enterprise Patterns
- **Opinionated for Stratus**: Designed for specific corporate architecture
- **Centralized Control**: IaC repository manages all environments
- **Standardized Naming**: Consistent resource naming conventions
- **Comprehensive Tagging**: Full resource metadata for governance

### Developer Experience
- **Simple Setup**: Two files to get started
- **Clear Documentation**: Extensive examples and troubleshooting
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive CI/CD validation
- **Community Friendly**: Welcoming to contributors

## 🔍 Key Constraints & Limitations

### Stratus-Specific Constraints
- **Corporate network requirements**: Private endpoints for storage accounts
- **OIDC federation requirements**: Specific subject format for federated credentials
- **Naming conventions**: Azure reserved prefixes must be avoided
- **Team structure**: `HafslundEcoVannkraft/stratus-az-platform-approvers` team

### Technical Constraints
- **Root module only**: Cannot be used as child module (import blocks, provider configs)
- **GitHub CLI preferred**: Better security than Personal Access Tokens
- **Remote state dependency**: Requires upstream infrastructure outputs

## 📋 Common Patterns & Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- **Resources**: `{code_name}-{resource_type}-{environment}-{purpose/identifier}-{suffix}`
- **Environments**: `{deployment_target}-{azure_environment}-{operation}`
- **Examples**: `myapp-rg-dev-github-identities-a1b2`, `web-dev-ci`, `api-prod-cd`

### Configuration Patterns
- **Minimal setup**: Single environment, basic configuration
- **Multi-environment**: Separate files per Stratus Landing Zone
- **Multi-target**: Different deployment targets in same subscription
- **Complex**: Multiple Stratus LZ + multiple deployment targets

### Dynamic Role Assignment Patterns
```hcl
role_assignments = {
  global = [...]     # Always applied
  ci = [...]         # Applied to environments ending with '-ci'
  cd = [...]         # Applied to environments ending with '-cd'
  validate = [...]   # Applied to environments ending with '-validate'
  deploy = [...]     # Applied to environments ending with '-deploy'
  # Any custom suffix supported
}
```

## 🚨 Important Notes for AI

### What NOT to Suggest
- **Breaking changes** without clear migration path
- **Hardcoded values** that should be configurable
- **Security compromises** (static credentials, overly broad permissions)
- **GitHub API workarounds** that violate platform constraints
- **Container App specific solutions** when generic approaches exist

### What TO Prioritize
- **Generic infrastructure support** that works with any Azure service
- **Security best practices** and least privilege
- **Clear documentation** with working examples
- **Backward compatibility** when possible
- **Enterprise-ready solutions** that scale
- **Dynamic, convention-based approaches** over hardcoded logic

### Common Gotchas
- GitHub API limitations are real and must be worked around
- Stratus naming conventions are mandatory, not suggestions
- Remote state integration is critical for the architecture
- Corporate network restrictions affect testing and deployment
- Module is generic but workflows are still Stratus-opinionated

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Terraform validation and formatting
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing with GitHub App authentication
  - Creates GitHub App token for secure authentication
  - Dispatches actual `github-environment-vending.yml` workflow
  - Monitors workflow execution and verifies completion
  - Validates GitHub environments and configurations were created
  - Automatically cleans up resources via destroy workflow
- **Manual Testing**: Local development with GitHub CLI authentication
- **Security Testing**: OIDC federation and permission validation

> **For AI Assistants**: This project is production-ready and used by multiple teams. The module is now generic for any Azure infrastructure while maintaining Stratus workflow patterns. Changes should be conservative, well-documented, and maintain backward compatibility. When in doubt, ask for clarification about Stratus-specific requirements or corporate constraints.

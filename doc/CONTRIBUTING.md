## üîß **Advanced Development** (for complex contributions)

### **Development Environment Setup**

For major features or complex bug fixes, you'll need:

- **Terraform** >= 1.9.0
- **GitHub CLI** (for testing workflows)
- **Azure CLI** (for testing Azure integration)
- Access to a test Azure subscription

### **Branch Strategy**

```bash
# Create a feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch naming conventions**:

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates

### **Advanced Testing**

For complex changes:

```bash
# Validate YAML examples
yq . examples/*.yaml

# Test example configurations
terraform plan -var-file=test/test.tfvars
```

### **Documentation Updates**

When adding features:

- Update README if adding new functionality
- Update examples if changing configuration
- Update variable documentation

### **Conventional Commits** (optional but appreciated)

For better change tracking:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(validation): add Azure naming constraint validation"
git commit -m "fix(github): resolve API rate limiting issues"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update configuration examples"
```

## üôè **Recognition**

All contributors are recognized in our release notes and GitHub contributors list.

## ü§ñ **AI-Assisted Development**

If you're using AI tools to help with contributions:

- **Read the AI Context**: Check [AI_CONTEXT.md](AI_CONTEXT.md) for essential project context
- **Understand Constraints**: Be aware of GitHub API limitations and Stratus-specific requirements
- **Follow Patterns**: Maintain existing naming conventions and architectural patterns
- **Test Thoroughly**: AI-generated code should be validated locally before submission

The AI context file provides comprehensive background that helps AI assistants understand the project's architecture, constraints, and best practices.
